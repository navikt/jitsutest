/**
 * This script is used during build time only. It compliments `prisma schema push` and should be run after it.
 *
 * It makes sure that certain objects, such as views and triggers, that cannot be defined in Prisma schema are created in the database.
 * It does so by executing SQL scripts that are located in a directory provided as a first argument.
 *
 * It also relies on presence of APPLICATION_DATABASE_URL environment variable (same as `prisma schema push`).
 *
 * NOTE: This as mostly a copy of webapps/console/scripts/sql-exec.ts, since ee-api and console doesn't have a common dependency where we
 * can put this script. A little copy-paste is not a big deal!
